** Where to find our database of lies

We'll use [[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html][this opinion piece]] from the New York Times (last updated more than a year ago, sadly).

[[figures/screenshot.png]]

Several data points in this piece:

- The article is a (long) list,
- Each list item is a lie,
- Each lie is made of a date, of a statement, of an explanation of why this statement is untrue, and a supporting link
  
** Scraping in R

Scraping is downloading data from a webpage, as much as it is creating structure out of this data.

Conceptually we will want to achive something like this:

| date   | statement                     | counter statement       | supporting link   |
| Jan 21 | I didn't want to go into Iraq | He was for an invastion | https://something |

** Setting up tooling in R

We'll use the ~rvest~ package:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
library(rvest)
page <- read_html("https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html")
page

{xml_document}
<html lang="en" class="no-js page-interactive section-opinion page-theme-standard tone-opinion page-interactive-default limit-small layout-xlarge app-interactive" itemid="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/23/opinion/trumps-lies.html" itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle" itemscope="" xmlns:og="http://opengraphprotocol.org/schema/">
[1] <head>\n<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">\n<script>\nif (docume ...
[2] <body>\n<style>\n.lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions {\n  display: block !important;\n  height: 50px; ...
#+END_SRC

** TODO A word on the web
*** The DOM

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The DOM is a hierarchy/ tree of Javascript node objects
#+END_QUOTE

*** Structure of a webpage

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<body>
  <article>
    <h1>This is a simple title</h1>

    <h1 id="special">This is another title... 
      <em>with a twist!</em>
    </h1>
  </article>
</body>
#+END_SRC

HTML is composed of tags: ~<tag>~

** Making sense of our lies data

This is what each lie in the big ~<ol>~ (for Ordered List) looks like:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<span class="short-desc">
    <strong> DATE </strong> LIE
    <span class="short-truth">
        <a href="URL"> EXPLANATION </a>
    </span>
</span>
#+END_SRC

*** Collecting all the lie "containers"
     
See this ~<span class="short-desc">~?
We can target the ~class~ to select all tags/nodes that carry this class:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
lie_containers <- page %>% html_nodes(".short-desc")
lie_containers %>% head()

{xml_nodeset (6)}
[1] <span class="short-desc"><strong>Jan. 21 </strong>“I wasn't a fan of Iraq...
[2] <span class="short-desc"><strong>Jan. 21 </strong>“A reporter for Time ma...
[3] <span class="short-desc"><strong>Jan. 23 </strong>“Between 3 million and ...
#+END_SRC

We end up with a list of 180 items.

** Extracting the date

Dates are stored here:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<strong> DATE </strong>
#+END_SRC

As previously we can use ~html_nodes~:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
lie_containers %>%
  html_nodes("strong")

{xml_nodeset (180)}
[1] <strong>Jan. 21 </strong>
[2] <strong>Jan. 21 </strong>
[3] <strong>Jan. 23 </strong>
#+END_SRC

*** Getting the text out

Obviously we don't want to keep the tags in there.

Also we want to trim these rogue spaces at the beginning and the end of the string:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
lie_containers %>%
  html_nodes("strong") %>%
  html_text(trim= TRUE)

[1] "Jan. 21"  "Jan. 21"  "Jan. 23"  "Jan. 25"  "Jan. 25"
#+END_SRC

** Extracting the lie
    
Getting the lie itself is a bit more difficult. Here's our structure again:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<span class="short-desc">
    <strong> DATE </strong> LIE
    <span class="short-truth">
        <a href="URL"> EXPLANATION </a>
    </span>
</span>
#+END_SRC

~LIE~ is not within any tag...

*** XML contents

Fortunately, thanks to some magic (and because the page is well structured), we can use a trick:
    
#+BEGIN_SRC R
xml_contents(lie_containers[1])

{xml_nodeset (3)}
[1] <strong>Jan. 21 </strong>
[2] “I wasn't a fan of Iraq. I didn't want to go into Iraq.” 
[3] <span class="short-truth"><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump- ...
#+END_SRC

Running ~xml_contents()~ on a list element gives us yet another list; it contains three elements, the second one being our lie. Thus:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
xml_contents(lie_containers[1])[2]

{xml_nodeset (1)}
[1] “I wasn't a fan of Iraq. I didn't want to go into Iraq.” 
#+END_SRC

** Extracting the explanation
    
The explanation is easy because it is contained in the ~.short-truth~ tag:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
lie_containers %>%
  html_nodes(".short-truth") %>%
  html_text(trim= TRUE)
[1] "(He was for an invasion before he was against it.)"                                                                                 
[2] "(Trump was on the cover 11 times and Nixon appeared 55 times.)"                                                                     
[3] "(There's no evidence of illegal voting.)"   
#+END_SRC

** Extracting the supporting link
   
The supporting link is contained in a ~<a>~ tag: it is a link.

Here's how a link looks like in HTML:

#+BEGIN_SRC html
<a href="https://website.com">text of the link</a>
#+END_SRC

We extract the link only like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
lie_containers %>%
  html_nodes("a") %>%
  html_attr("href")
[1] "https://www.buzzfeed.com/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the"                                                                                                                                                                    
[2] "http://nation.time.com/2013/11/06/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-time/"                                                                                                                                                                                                  
[3] "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/donald-trump-congress-democrats.html"   
#+END_SRC

** String operations

Our strings aren't very clean. We can use the ~stringr~ package to make them a bit nicer to work with.

#+BEGIN_SRC R
str_c("21 Feb", ", 2017")
[1] "21 Feb, 2017"

str_sub("'quote marks'", 2, -2)
[1] "quote marks"
#+END_SRC

* Iteration and scraping
    
A programming pattern you will see regularly is the following:

- We create an empty thing/variable: our final dataset, empty for now
- We have a list of things we need to do some work on
- We iterate over each item in this list, build a temporary store
- Then for each iteration we append the temporary store to our main dataset

When we're finished running over each element in our main list, we end up with a complete main dataset!

** For loop

The tool for the job is the for loop:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
vector <- c('one', 'two', 'basile')
for (variable in vector) {
  print(variable)
}

[1] "one"
[1] "two"
[1] "basile"
#+END_SRC

*** Appending to an empty list

Conceptually, we'll do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
# our main dataset
records <- vector("list")

for (lie in lie_containers) {
  # store the date
  # store the lie
  # store the explanation
  # store the url
  
  # our temporary date store with all the right columns
  df <- data_frame(date, lie, explanation, url)
  
  # send our temporary data store back up
  # to populate our main dataset
  records <- rbind(records, df)
}
#+END_SRC

*** Putting it all together

#+BEGIN_SRC R
records <- vector("list")

for (i in seq_along(lie_containers)) {
  date <- lie_containers[i] %>% 
            html_nodes("strong") %>% 
            html_text(trim = TRUE)
  lie <- xml_contents(lie_containers[i])[2] %>% 
          html_text(trim = TRUE)
  explanation <- lie_containers[i] %>%
                  html_nodes(".short-truth") %>%
                  html_text(trim = TRUE)
  url <- lie_containers[i] %>% 
          html_nodes("a") %>%
          html_attr("href")
  df <- data_frame(date = str_c(date, ", 2017"), 
                   lie = str_sub(lie, 2, -2), 
                   explanation = str_sub(explanation, 2, -2), 
                   url = url)
  records <- rbind(records, df)
}

> df %>% head()
# A tibble: 6 x 4
  date     lie                             explanation                    url                           
  <chr>    <chr>                           <chr>                          <chr>
