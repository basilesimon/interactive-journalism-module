* TODO teaching plan
** Week 1 - The basics

  The mysterious creature that is the DOM, what a webpage actually is, and using the DevTools.  

  We'll have a look at the very basics of working with the web. Having done the pre-course work (Codecademy Javascript tutorial), we hopefully won't lost much time. No set-up involved, j5ust simple practical exercises in a web browser

*** Session 1: practical exercises
*** Session 2: more exercises

** Week 2 - Working with Python and data

  A foundation session in which we'll talk about some basics such as file formats and, er, where do you write code in the first place. We'll rattle through some online resources and communities where you can get help if you're stuck with a problem.
  During the second session we'll see the basics of the Python programming language.

*** Session 1: file formats, writing code, exploratory data analysis
*** Session 2: intro to Python

** Week 3 - Concrete scraping examples in Python

  A heavy session made up of short examples we'll study and extract data from.

*** Session 1: simple scraping
*** Session 2: more complex scraping, saving data

** Week 4 - R in the newsroom

  Armed with our new best friend RStudio, we'll introduce the R programming language and explore the fantastic `tidyverse`, as well as plotting our first charts.

*** Session 1: the tidyverse
*** Session 2: ggplot

** Week 5 - Concrete R exercises

  We'll touch on statistics concepts and keep proving how great R is at prototyping and wrangling data and charts.

*** Session 1: data cleaning exercises
*** Session 2: enough stats to keep you out of trouble

** Week 6 - More R
   
  ???

** Week 7 - Into Javascript charts world

  An overview of what is data viz and how central D3.js is to the discipline. We'll however pivot quickly towards Highcharts.js for its simplicity. As for the R sessions, we'll work through basic plotting then more complex examples.

*** Session 1: overview of the discipline, Highcharts
*** Session 2: Highcharts + misc explorations

** Weeks 8, 9, 10 - Project work

  We will go round the room and take questions from students about their final project. Come prepared with actual problems, be happy to work collaboratively and to make progress in class while we tackle challenges collectively, on the big screen. These sessions are usually the time when "ha-ha" moments happen.

   mid-April?
** cherry on top: build in JS week 3
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Build a simple interactive thing, in Javascript. This can be a series of buttons on which to click to change a displayed information, for example. The action triggered will involve a function. Example: display "1". Upon clicking this button, a function adds 2 and displays "3". Ask the user for a number to add, display the result of 3+n.
    #+END_QUOTE

   We'll talk about this project in class

** assessment two: final project
    
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Your project should identify and solve a journalistic problem, using data and coding work. Typically this will focus on a story -- either a complete story or an interactive feature forming part of a story. It could also be something for use in a newsroom (eg a tool helpful to journalists). 
   #+END_QUOTE

   that's from the course specs

** more about the final project
   Your project must be relevant to journalism (see above), operate at a functional level (at least as a working prototype), and involve all of the following:

   - data techniques, involving scraping, cleaning, analysis and/or presentation, as needed/appropriate to your project
   - adding value through user interactivity
   - use and modification of html, CSS, Javascript, Python, R, d3 
   - and/or other code (not simply plug-and-play elements)
   - use of free and/or low-cost tools
   - problem-solving.

   (that's also from the spec)

** the self-learner attitude - what is that?
   I want you to engage in the community of data-journalists, news hackers and tinkerers

** what is the DOM?
   [http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1]

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The DOM is a hierarchy/tree of Javascript node objects
   #+END_QUOTE

   - It looks like the HTML you wrote
   - It actually is the programming interface around it

** programming interface?
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <body>
     <article>
       <h1>This is a simple title</h1>

       <h1 id="special">This is another title...

   The Dev Tools: the Swiss army knife of web work

   What you can do with Dev Tools:
   - Edit the DOM directly
   - Change styles of any page
   - See Javascript code and errors
   - See and edit any file loaded by the page

** let's access the Dev Tools
   On Chrome and Firefox
   - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` 
   - or `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I` on a Mac

** do things with the Dev Tools
   Inspect and edit pages and style: 
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/][exercise one]]
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-styles][exercise two]]
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-dom][exercise three]]

** editing HTML with the Dev Tools
   Example: make Donald Trump say anything with the Dev Tools!

** hiding things with the Dev Tools
   Example: hide something on the [[https://www.google.co.uk/][Google homepage]]

** codecademy homework
** what's a variable?

   A variable is a store, in which you can put different data:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - your age (a number)
   - your name (a string)
   - the result of a logical operation (true/false)
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var myAge = 26;
   var myName = "Basile";
   var doITeachAtCity = true;
   #+END_SRC

** what are the different data types?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *string*: takes quotation marks around it. example: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var name = "basile"; var age = "30";
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *number*: no quotation marks. example: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var number = 10; var budget = 1245.5;
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *boolean*: logical operators: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var basileIsHere = true; var basileIsShaved = false;
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *array/list* (more later)
   - *object* (more later)
   - *null/undefined*
** data types: lists/arrays
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var thisIsAList = [1,2,3,'basile'];
   #+END_SRC

   contained between brackets, they store items in them. we can access these items like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   thisIsAList[0] // 1
   thisIsAList[3] // 'basile'
   #+END_SRC

   Note: lists are said 'zero-padded'
** data types: objects
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var thisIsAnObject = { name: 'basile', age: 26 };
   #+END_SRC

   kind of like lists, but object items can be accessed by their key, like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   console.log(thisIsAnObject.name); // 'basile'
   console.log(thisIsAnObject.age); // 26
   #+END_SRC

** what we use data types for

   different data have different use cases.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - text is obviously a **string**
   - if you try to plot numbers on a chart or do maths, you better use **numbers**, not strings
   - **booleans** will be useful to do logical checks, e.g. "show me all MPs whose age is over 60"

** what we use data types for (repeat)

   different data have different use cases.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - **lists** can be *iterated over*, i.e. "for each element in this list, do that"
   
     think of an Excel column with a formula that you drag down to apply it to all cells
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - **objects** are excellent *data stores* and more rich than so-called *flat* lists

** the for loop
   very useful pattern: `for` iterates over list items.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var myList = [1,2,10,37];

   myList.forEach(function(element) {
     console.log(element);
     console.log(element + 1);
   }
   // 1, 2, 10, 37
   // 2, 3, 11, 38
   #+END_SRC

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - for each item  in my array,
   - log the said item plus one.

** the function

   functions are used to break down your code into separate, simple tasks

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   function sayMyName(name) {
     console.log('HELLO' + name);
   };
   sayMyName('basile') // HELLO basile
   #+END_SRC

** the function (repeat)
   iterating over an array with a function

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   // define a function like so
   function applyFunction(takesAVariableIn) {
     console.log(takesAVariableIn + ' is great'!
   }

   // define a variable, an array/list in this case
   var thisIsAVariable = ['basile', 'city uni'];

   // for each element of the array, run the function
   thisIsAVariable.forEach(function(element) {
     applyFunction(element);
   })
   #+END_SRC

** writing code: online code editors
   
   Purpose: no need to put files on your computer
   Just write code and go

   Tip: you might need the devtools to see your javascript!

** file formats

   as for scripts (instructions) and web pages, we sometimes need to store data in files ("datasets").

   that's what you'd get from the ONS, data.gov.uk, an API, etc.

   there are different file formats for different purposes.

** file formats: CSV

   standing for Comma-Separated Values, CSV will be of much use to us when it comes to data.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   myfile.csv
   #+END_SRC

   think of a spreadsheet without any formatting: 
   * every line in the file is a row,
   * every comma-separated value is a cell

*** CSV structure

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   name, occupation, height
   basile, journalist, 187
   donald, politician, 188
   #+END_SRC

** file formats: JSON

   standing for JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is almost universally used on the web.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   myfile.json
   #+END_SRC

   structure in objects (`var anObject = {};`) separated by commas.
   made up of `key: value` pairs.

*** JSON structure

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   var json = {
     "name": "Basile Simon",
     "occupation": "journalist",
     "friends": [ "pierre", "donald", "theresa"]
   }
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   json.name => "Basile Simon"
   json.friends[0]` => "pierre"
   #+END_SRC

   https://codepen.io/basilesimon/pen/MrZWZg?editors=1010#

** JSON and CSV in this course

   we're likely to store data when scraping, cleaning, etc. in CSV format.
   we'll probably use, or "parse" CSV data into JSON for the web.

   d3.js has a CSV parser: from the CSV above

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   name, occupation, height
   basile, journalist, 187
   donald, politician, 188
   #+END_SRC

   we parse it as JSON, so we can run `data.name` and get "basile" back

** file formats: Excel, databases

   Excel/ Google Spreadsheets are **visual representations** or CSV data

   Databases come with, as the DOM does, their programming interface and language (eg SQL)

** a word about Python
** Python
   
    Python is a programming language created in 1991.

    It is the most taught programming language around the world.

*** Why Python?

    Newsroom use: https://www.poynter.org/news/introduction-newsroom-programming-technologies

    Python is very easy to read and to use - and many newsrooms use it.

    **If you can write Python, you can write anything.**
   
** What Python looks like

    **Javascript**
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    var foo = 'bar';
    function myFunction(parameter) {
      console.log(parameter);
    };
    #+END_SRC

    **Python**
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    foo = 'bar'
    def myFunction(parameter):
        print(parameter)
    #+END_SRC

** running your pythons: the notebook
    
    Python also comes with a set of utilities bundled in a GUI: [[http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb][the Jupyter Notebook]]

    We can run Python notebooks from the university computers.

*** How?

    - Open the page
    - Fire up your DevTools
    - Tinker with the DOM to spot the consistency
    - Understand the tree structure to reach the elements you want

    Scraping is all about targeting the right element(s), and/or identifying the patterns in the document.
    
    Because through programming, patterns can be pried open and stripped bare, leaving only the relevant information.

*** Let's get scraping

    aList = [1,2,'lol']

    # an if statement

** scraping traitors
*** understanding the page structure
    
    - two <blockquote>
    - each contaning many <em>
    - each <em> containing our data points
 
*** mostly, it looks like so

    "name (party - constituency)"

    eg 

    #+BEGIN_SRC 
    Martyn Day (Scottish National Party – Linlithgow and East Falkirk)
    Maria Eagle (Labour – Garston and Halewood)
    #+END_SRC

*** problems

    - a few _Labour (Co-op)
    - one SNP- Inverness

    This is the key issue with web scraping: dirty data!

*** back to our notebook!
** scraping: recap

   - for each <em> in each <blockquote>
   - split the text in different ways to create our variables
   - add our variables to a list
   - add this list to another list (a list of list, then)
   - each list in our list of list is a row
   - write CSV file

** scraping: result!

** spotting traitors

   Now that we've got our 122 names we want to see who betrayed their constituency: jump to `spotting-traitors`

** two routes for the final project
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)

   - option two: host your content on Medium/blog/Wordpress

   Obviously I will assess the two options differently, i.e.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - if you do more website, front-end work, I will be kinder on the data work
   - if you do little website-building, your data work must be top notch!

** scraping, scraping!

*** web scraping v API

    [[https://www.grepsr.com/web-scraping-vs-api/][a simple comparison]]:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - is an API available/hidden?
    - is the API actually up-to-date?
    - rate limiting
    - but better structure
   
   One thing to consider: the ethics of web scraping: see this recent [[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/ninth-circuit-doubles-down-violating-websites-terms-service-not-crime][Ninth Circuit ruling]] that violating a website's term of service is not a crime

*** web scraping

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   * if you're good enough
   
   good practice: set headers in your web requests identifying yourself

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   import requests
 
   headers = {'user-agent' : 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5);
                Basile Simon/ London/ basile.simon@thetimes.co.uk'}

   #+END_SRC

   [[https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-scrape-websites-with-python-and-beautifulsoup-5946935d93fe][A good tutorial]]

*** API scraping

    using an API is using an authorised service

** tools of the trade: the APIs

   [[https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2007/dec/14/thenutshellabeginnersguide][even the Guardian has a piece about "what's an API"]]

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The exception are sites built on open source code, which is sort of like a *worldwide hippy commune* of developers who share their notes. The idea is that they can make better products and software if lots of people collaborate on a project.
   #+END_QUOTE

   good API example: [[https://postcodes.io/][postcodes.io]]

** setup
*** register on twitter

    - log into your twitter account
    - register your phone number with your account
    - click on your profile pic (top left-hand side), then head to "Mobile"

*** create your (first?) twitter app

    https://apps.twitter.com/

    that's a common way to keep control of who's allowed to use your service.
    this way, they can shut your app down [[https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8731387/politwoops-sunlight-foundation-twitter][if you abuse your privileges]]

    [[./img/twitter-app-create.png]]
    
*** fill in application details

    [[./img/twitter-app-info.png]]

*** DO NOT publish your API keys etc.

    some people scrape the internet for published credentials. they could take over your account, post whatever they want in your name, including sending DMs. you've been warned.
** how to use an API?

   - read the documentation
   - find a convenient wrapper library that does the heavy lifting for you

   in our case: that's [[http://tweepy.readthedocs.io/en/v3.5.0/getting_started.html][tweepy]], a wrapper library around the twitter API built in python.

*** here is a template!

    [[https://github.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/tree/master/website-template][see on Github]]

    HTML index file + CSS + Javascript from a web framework called Bootstrap.

    contains all the assets you'd need, with pre-defined CSS and style rules. Download, take the bits you don't want out, play with it as much as you like, and *try to re-use bits of it.*

    the purpose of that framework is to have you write as little basic CSS as possible!

** what is R

   R is a programming language very popular among statisticians, researchers, and data scientists.

   In addition to traditional data structures, R comes out of the box with regression models, time-series support, geo capabilities, and many stats shorthands.

   [[./images/R_logo.svg.png]]

** why R?

   FiveThirtyEight, Buzzfeed, The Times, The Guardian, some German newsrooms...

   for some reason R has gained popularity in newsrooms among data specialists

*** should I choose R or Python?

    no right answer to this question!
    R v Python: [[https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis][an infographic]]

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - many ways to write R: several schools of thought
   - Python is more consistent across users: meaningful indentation helps
   - you can do anything with Python, R is slightly more focused
   - Python online documentation/community is more beginner-friendly
   - pure salary from survey: R about +20% (one of the most top-paying languages)
   
    R isn't exactly the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python][Zen of Python...]]
    
** elements of syntax

*** the basics
    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    # a comment
    
    # a variable
    foo <- 'bar'
    
    # a list, called a 'vector'
    foo <- c(1, 2, 'lol')
    #+END_SRC

*** functions and for loops?

    the so-called "R way" is very much line-by-line, not that much oriented towards functions and iterators

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    foo <- c(1, 3, 'some data', 'not to remove')
    foo_clean <- foo[-(1:2)]
    #+END_SRC

** the tidyverse

   there are several ways to write R. an important one follows Hadley Wickham's philosophy and work at RStudio.

   it is called *[[https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/][the tidyverse]*

   > The tidyverse is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy

   [[./images/tidyverse1.png]]

*** tidy data

    [[https://hackyhour.github.io/Goettingen/slides/tidy_slides.html#/][principles of tidy data]], a presentation (built in RStudio!) from Wickham's paper [[http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf]["Tidy Data"]]

*** a set of tools

    example: the pipe `%>%`

    #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
    const foo = [1,2,10];
    foo.forEach(function(element) {
      if (element > 2) {
        return element;
      }
    });
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    foo <- c(1,2,10)
    foo %>%
      filter( > 2)
    #+END_SRC

*** the pipe II

    > The operators pipe their left-hand side values forward into expressions that appear on the right-hand side, i.e. one can replace f(x) with x %>% f(), where %>% is the (main) pipe-operator. 

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    the_data <-
      read.csv('/path/to/data/file.csv') %>%
      subset(variable_a > x) %>%
      transform(variable_c = variable_a/variable_b) %>%
      head(100)
    #+END_SRC

*** pipes and verbs

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    cars <- cars %>%
      mutate(pounds = weight / 1000)
    #+END_SRC

** dplyr tutorial

   [[http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html]]

   - `select()`
   - `filter()`
   - `%>%`
   - `mutate()`
   - `group_by()`

  an editor who realises we're two weeks away from an election

** the output

   [[./images/pop.png]]

*** well, not quite...

   [[./images/Rplot.png]]

** the source
   
   We need a data source for the polls.

   There is an official source, which is an ASPX app that looked too daunting.

   Easy-looking one: [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_Italian_general_election,_2018#Graphical_summary][a Wikipedia table]]

   So what do we have here?

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - a <table> element
   - several, actually!
   - contains all the polling from different institutes
  
** scraping the source

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   # install.packages('rvest')
   library(rvest)

   url <- 'https://a-url.com'
   df <- url %>%
         read_html() %>%
         html_node(xpath="an/xpath/") %>%
         html_table()
   #+END_SRC

*** example
  
   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   url <- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers_(school_massacres)'
   url %>% read_html() %>%
      html_node(xpath='/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[4]/div/table[4]') %>%
      html_table() %>%
      View()
   #+END_SRC

*** problems for us

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - our columns are all messed up!
   - oh, also our numbers look like strings?!

** cleaning our data

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - our dates aren't going to be practical to work with
   - too many columns
   - not a tidy representation of data

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   **Rule of thumb for dates**: the closer to YYYY-MM-DD you are the easier it will be to convert to a proper date

*** this horrible code

  #+BEGIN_SRC R
  mutate(cut_date = paste(tail(strsplit(date, "–")[[1]], n=1), " 2018")) %>%
  mutate(clean_date = as.Date(cut_date, format="%d %b %Y"))
  #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC R
  foo = "2-7 Feb"
  strsplit(foo, "-")[[1]]   -> list: ["2", "7 Feb"]
  tail(the_above), n=1)     -> "7 Feb"
  paste(the_above, " 2018") -> "7 Feb 2018"
  as.Date(the_above, format="%d %b %Y")  is a win!
  #+END_SRC

*** melting our data into tidy format

    this is what we have:

    |       date | firm | party one | party two | party three | etc |
    | 2017-01-01 | ipso |        24 |        32 |          10 | n   |
    | 2017-01-02 | ipso |        22 |        31 |           9 | n   |

*** melting our data into tidy format
    
    this is what we want:

    |       date | party | value |
    | 2017-01-01 | one   |    24 |
    | 2017-01-01 | two   |    32 |
    | 2017-01-01 | three |    10 |
    | 2017-01-02 | one   |    22 |
    | 2017-01-02 | two   |    31 |
    | 2017-01-02 | three |     9 |

*** the solution: melt()

    [[http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html][melt()]]

** visualising our data

   `ggplot` is awesome.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   # install.packages('ggplot2')
   library(ggplot2)

   ggplot(data, aes( x = a_column, y = another_column )) +
     geom_point() +
     geom_bar()
   #+END_SRC

   dataset + aesthetics (which bit of the data goes where) + coordinate system + geometries

** adding value to our data to answer a question

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   How well do we think these parties are doing, from these very different polls, and over time?
   #+END_QUOTE

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   sounds like a job for avering things out.

*** merging data

    our two datasets having been prepared in the same way, with the same column names... the merge is super easy:

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    merge(dataframe_1, dataframe_2)
    #+END_SRC

    normally, you'd do:

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    merge(dataframe_1, dataframe_2, by="id")
    #+END_SRC

    where "id" is a column the two datasets share (remember how we merged on the constituency names for the MPs, in Python...)

*** averaging

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    rollapply(value, width = 20,
       fill = NA, partial = TRUE, 
       FUN=function(x) mean(x, na.rm=TRUE),
       align = "right")
    #+END_SRC

   | SIC07 | description      | number                    | degrees                                   | mean        |
   |       | work description | number of people employed | percentage of secondary education degrees | mean income |

** basic plot

   we pass our dataset data and define the aesthetics: an x and y axis:

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   ggplot(data, aes(x = Mean, y = Degrees)) +
       geom_point()
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/archive/2016-2017/week6/week6-figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png]]

*** Make the bubble size represent the number of people in this field

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   ggplot(data, aes(x = Mean, y = Degrees, size = Number)) +
       geom_point()
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/archive/2016-2017/week6/week6-figure/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png]]

*** Make the bubbles bigger by setting a maximum

   we can reuse the previous chart we built, simply adding a layer with the plus (+) sign:

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   ggplot(data, aes(x = Mean, y = Degrees, size = Number)) +
       geom_point() +
       scale_size_area(max_size = 15)
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/archive/2016-2017/week6/week6-figure/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png]]

*** Add a progressive colour scale depending on the number of people

   that's a new property called `fill`. It will assign default colours for you.

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   ggplot(data, aes(x = Mean, y = Degrees, size = Number, fill=Number)) +
       scale_size_area(max_size = 15) +
       geom_point(shape=21)
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/archive/2016-2017/week6/week6-figure/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png]]

*** Make our axis prettier and more sensible

   again, re-using our previous chart, we set two additional layers that apply to the axis:

   #+BEGIN_SRC R
   library(scales)
   ggplot(data, aes(x = Mean, y = Degrees, size = Number, fill=Number)) +
       scale_size_area(max_size = 15) +
       geom_point(shape=21) +
       scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 70000, 10000)) +
       scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
   #+END_SRC

   [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilesimon/interactive-journalism-module/archive/2016-2017/week6/week6-figure/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png]]

*** A logarithmic y-axis, maybe?

   #+BEGIN_SRC R

       scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 70000, 10000)) +

** fun with the 2013 Italian election 

   We're going to plot the results in each of the 101 districts against some indicators:

   - levels of migration
   - number of patents per 10,000 inhabitants
   - and Purchasing Power Standard

** the linear regression

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The linear regression is a linear approach for *modelling the relationship* between a scalar *dependent variable y* and one or more *explanatory variables* (or independent variables) denoted X.
  #+END_QUOTE

  ie how accurately does a variable help explain an observation?

  [[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/220px-Linear_regression.svg.png]]

*** linear models in R
    
    to fit a linear model onto a dataframe, we store the result of `lm(x ~ y)` into a variable:

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    model <- lm(observation_column ~ variable_column,
                data=df)
    #+END_SRC

    in `ggplot`, `geom_smooth(method="lm")` will draw a line onto our plot:

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    ggplot(df, aes(x=x, y=y)) +
      geom_smooth(method="lm")
    #+END_SRC

*** but how good is my model?

    R-squared is the metric you don't want to miss.

    #+BEGIN_SRC R
    > summary(model)
    Adjusted R-squared: somewhere between 0 and 1
    #+END_SRC

    the closer to 1 the better!

*** correlation != causation

    [[https://www.ft.com/content/94e3acec-a767-11e7-ab55-27219df83c97]]

    r-squared indicates the strength of the relationship... you can't infer causation from this.

** recap from Wednesday
** exercise

   based on the work we've done on Wednesday we're going to work through other examples

*** example one

   there is a file called  `data/nama_10r_3gdp_1_Data.csv` that contains 2013 Power Purchasing Standard data

   [[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Purchasing_power_standard_(PPS)][what is the PPS?]], you ask?

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The purchasing power standard is an artificial currency unit. Theoretically, one PPS can buy the same amount of goods and services in each country. However, price differences across borders mean that different amounts of national currency units are needed for the same goods and services depending on the country. PPS are derived by dividing any economic aggregate of a country in national currency by its respective purchasing power parities. 
   #+END_QUOTE

*** example one

    1. take this file, load it into R
    2. clean it if need be
    3. merge it with out results
    4. draw a scatterplot comparing PPS in each district with each party's vote share

   remember: the file is called  `data/nama_10r_3gdp_1_Data.csv` 

*** example two

    same deal, but with the number of patents per 10,000 inhabitants

    the file is `data/pat_ep_rtec_1_Data.csv`

** d3.js

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   D3 allows you to bind arbitrary data to a Document Object Model (DOM), and then apply data-driven transformations to the document.

*** familiarity

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    D3’s vocabulary of graphical marks comes directly from web standards: HTML, SVG, and CSS.

    D3 is easy to debug using the browser’s built-in element inspector: the nodes that you manipulate with D3 are exactly those that the browser understands natively.

** what d3 code looks like

   [[./img/bar.png]]

   this "how to make a bar chart" tutorial, by d3.js co-creator [[https://bost.ocks.org/mike/][Mike Bostock]], contains everything you need to know.

   let's have a look:

   - [[https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/][part 1: selecting an element, using methods, scaling]]
   - [[https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/][part 2: loading data]]
   - [[https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/3/][part 3: rotating the plot, adding axes and scales]]

** TODO how do I write d3 code?

   1. blockbuilder
   2. in files, obviously!

*** blockbuilder

    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The whole point of this project is to make it easier for you to make blocks. Blocks are the de-facto way of sharing visualizations and code samples in the d3.js community. Invented and hosted by Mike Bostock, blocks are key to realizing the power of examples.
    #+END_QUOTE

*** TODO writing code with a text editor
** popularity of the tool

   [[http://kyrandale.com/static/talks/reveal.js/index_pydata2015.html#/][dataviz with (Python and) Javascript]] 

   a (great!) online presentation at PyData London 2015

   we could substitute Python for R, the pipeline would be similar.

** so, d3.js it is?

   d3.js currently is the leading tool for dataviz online.

   **however**

   d3 is:

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - far too complicated for the time we've got
   - now a tool large newsrooms leave to specialists
   - for beginners, not the best tool to shine

*** hard

    d3 is **hard**

    You have to set up:

    - Your own canvas/ SVG container
    - Your axis and their domain and extent
    - The way you want to represent your data

    There are few helpers to guide you!

    You chart is nothing more than DOM elements you throw on a canvas.

    - A bar chart is rectangles of varied heights placed along an x-axis
    - A scatterplot is a bunch of elements with x/y coordinates
    - Areas must be calculated manually
    - And so must angles
    - X/Y depend on your scales: linear? timeseries? logarithmic?

** an alternative: Highcharts

   [[http://www.highcharts.com/products/highcharts]]

*** highcharts

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
    - Works everywhere + responsive
    - License is free for non-commercial
    - Many chart types and documented examples
    - Syntax is configuration-oriented
    - Handles tooltips, date axis...
    - Export charts as images or SVG for embed
    - And probably much more...

** our first Highcharts chart

   [[http://www.highcharts.com/docs/getting-started/your-first-chart]]

   What you need:

   - An HTML <div>
   - Some Javascript instantiating a charts on your <div>

  [[http://jsfiddle.net/43tnpxc6/][Example]]

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
    $('#container').highcharts({
        series: [{
            type: 'bar',
            data: [5, 7, 3]

*** Series = your chart data

    http://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/series

    Should remind you of lists and objects:

    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    [1, 2, 10, 42]
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    {
      name: 'Point 1',
      y: 0
    },{
      name: 'Point 2',
      y: 5
    }
    #+END_SRC

*** Chart types

    Highcharts allow you to build all kinds of charts:

    http://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-and-series-types/chart-types

    Using series, we can combine chart types, eg a bar chart with a line on top:
