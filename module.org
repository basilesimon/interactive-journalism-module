* teaching plan
** Week 1 - The basics

  The mysterious creature that is the DOM, what a webpage actually is, and using the DevTools.  

  We'll have a look at the very basics of working with the web. Having done the pre-course work (Codecademy Javascript tutorial), we hopefully won't lost much time. No set-up involved, just simple practical exercises in a web browser

*** Session 1: practical exercises
*** Session 2: more exercises

** Week 2 - Working with Python and data

  A foundation session in which we'll talk about some basics such as file formats and, er, where do you write code in the first place. We'll rattle through some online resources and communities where you can get help if you're stuck with a problem.
  During the second session we'll see the basics of the Python programming language.

*** Session 1: file formats, writing code
*** Session 2: intro to Python

** Week 3 - Concrete scraping examples in Python

  A heavy session made up of short examples we'll study and extract data from.

*** Session 1: simple scraping
*** Session 2: more complex scraping, saving data

** Week 4 - R in the newsroom

  Armed with our new best friend RStudio, we'll introduce the R programming language and explore the fantastic `tidyverse`, as well as plotting our first charts.

*** Session 1: the tidyverse
*** Session 2: ggplot

** Week 5 - Concrete R exercises

  We'll touch on statistics concepts and keep proving how great R is at prototyping and wrangling data and charts.

*** Session 1: data cleaning exercises
*** Session 2: enough stats to keep you out of trouble

** Week 6 - More R
   
  ???

** Week 7 - Into Javascript charts world

  An overview of what is data viz and how central D3.js is to the discipline. We'll however pivot quickly towards Highcharts.js for its simplicity. As for the R sessions, we'll work through basic plotting then more complex examples.

*** Session 1: overview of the discipline, Highcharts
*** Session 2: Highcharts + misc explorations

** Weeks 8, 9, 10 - Project work

  We will go round the room and take questions from students about their final project. Come prepared with actual problems, be happy to work collaboratively and to make progress in class while we tackle challenges collectively, on the big screen. These sessions are usually the time when "ha-ha" moments happen.

   Will take place on *week 5*

   i.e.
- Wed 21 
- or Fri 23
*** 75% final project
   mid-April?
** cherry on top: build in JS week 3
    #+BEGIN_QUOTE
    Build a simple interactive thing, in Javascript. This can be a series of buttons on which to click to change a displayed information, for example. The action triggered will involve a function. Example: display "1". Upon clicking this button, a function adds 2 and displays "3". Ask the user for a number to add, display the result of 3+n.
    #+END_QUOTE

   We'll talk about this project in class

** assessment two: final project
    
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Your project should identify and solve a journalistic problem, using data and coding work. Typically this will focus on a story -- either a complete story or an interactive feature forming part of a story. It could also be something for use in a newsroom (eg a tool helpful to journalists). 
   #+END_QUOTE

   that's from the course specs

** more about the final project
   Your project must be relevant to journalism (see above), operate at a functional level (at least as a working prototype), and involve all of the following:

   - data techniques, involving scraping, cleaning, analysis and/or presentation, as needed/appropriate to your project
   - adding value through user interactivity
   - use and modification of html, CSS, Javascript, Python, R, d3 
   - and/or other code (not simply plug-and-play elements)
   - use of free and/or low-cost tools
   - problem-solving.

   (that's also from the spec)

** the self-learner attitude - what is that?
   I want you to engage in the community of data-journalists, news hackers and tinkerers

** what is the DOM?
   [http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1]

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   The DOM is a hierarchy/tree of Javascript node objects
   #+END_QUOTE

   - It looks like the HTML you wrote
   - It actually is the programming interface around it

** programming interface?
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
   <body>
     <article>
       <h1>This is a simple title</h1>

       <h1 id="special">This is another title...

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   The Dev Tools: the Swiss army knife of web work

   What you can do with Dev Tools:
   - Edit the DOM directly
   - Change styles of any page
   - See Javascript code and errors
   - See and edit any file loaded by the page

** let's access the Dev Tools
   On Chrome and Firefox
   - `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` 
   - or `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I` on a Mac

** do things with the Dev Tools
   Inspect and edit pages and style: 
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/][exercise one]]
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-styles][exercise two]]
   - [[https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/edit-dom][exercise three]]

** editing HTML with the Dev Tools
   Example: make Donald Trump say anything with the Dev Tools!

** hiding things with the Dev Tools
   Example: hide something on the [[https://www.google.co.uk/][Google homepage]]

** codecademy homework
** what's a variable?

   A variable is a store, in which you can put different data:
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - your age (a number)
   - your name (a string)
   - the result of a logical operation (true/false)
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var myAge = 26;
   var myName = "Basile";
   var doITeachAtCity = true;
   #+END_SRC

** what are the different data types?
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *string*: takes quotation marks around it. example: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var name = "basile"; var age = "30";
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *number*: no quotation marks. example: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var number = 10; var budget = 1245.5;
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *boolean*: logical operators: 
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var basileIsHere = true; var basileIsShaved = false;
   #+END_SRC
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - *array/list* (more later)
   - *object* (more later)
   - *null/undefined*
** data types: lists/arrays
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var thisIsAList = [1,2,3,'basile'];
   #+END_SRC

   contained between brackets, they store items in them. we can access these items like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   thisIsAList[0] // 1
   thisIsAList[3] // 'basile'
   #+END_SRC

   Note: lists are said 'zero-padded'
** data types: objects
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var thisIsAnObject = { name: 'basile', age: 26 };
   #+END_SRC

   kind of like lists, but object items can be accessed by their key, like so:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   console.log(thisIsAnObject.name); // 'basile'
   console.log(thisIsAnObject.age); // 26
   #+END_SRC

** what we use data types for

   different data have different use cases.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - text is obviously a **string**
   - if you try to plot numbers on a chart or do maths, you better use **numbers**, not strings
   - **booleans** will be useful to do logical checks, e.g. "show me all MPs whose age is over 60"

** what we use data types for (repeat)

   different data have different use cases.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - **lists** can be *iterated over*, i.e. "for each element in this list, do that"
   
     think of an Excel column with a formula that you drag down to apply it to all cells
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - **objects** are excellent *data stores* and more rich than so-called *flat* lists

** the for loop
   very useful pattern: `for` iterates over list items.

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   var myList = [1,2,10,37];

   myList.forEach(function(element) {
     console.log(element);
     console.log(element + 1);
   }
   // 1, 2, 10, 37
   // 2, 3, 11, 38
   #+END_SRC

   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
   - for each item  in my array,
   - log the said item plus one.

** the function

   functions are used to break down your code into separate, simple tasks

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   function sayMyName(name) {
     console.log('HELLO' + name);
   };
   sayMyName('basile') // HELLO basile
   #+END_SRC

** the function (repeat)
   iterating over an array with a function

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   // define a function like so
   function applyFunction(takesAVariableIn) {
     console.log(takesAVariableIn + ' is great'!
   }

   // define a variable, an array/list in this case
   var thisIsAVariable = ['basile', 'city uni'];

   // for each element of the array, run the function
   thisIsAVariable.forEach(function(element) {
     applyFunction(element);
   })
   #+END_SRC

** writing code: online code editors
   
   Purpose: no need to put files on your computer
   Just write code and go

   Tip: you might need the devtools to see your javascript!

** file formats

   as for scripts (instructions) and web pages, we sometimes need to store data in files ("datasets").

   that's what you'd get from the ONS, data.gov.uk, an API, etc.

   there are different file formats for different purposes.

** file formats: CSV

   standing for Comma-Separated Values, CSV will be of much use to us when it comes to data.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   myfile.csv
   #+END_SRC

   think of a spreadsheet without any formatting: 
   * every line in the file is a row,
   * every comma-separated value is a cell

*** CSV structure

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   name, occupation, height
   basile, journalist, 187
   donald, politician, 188
   #+END_SRC

** file formats: JSON

   standing for JavaScript Object Notation, JSON is almost universally used on the web.

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   myfile.json
   #+END_SRC

   structure in objects (`var anObject = {};`) separated by commas.
   made up of `key: value` pairs.

*** JSON structure

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   var json = {
     "name": "Basile Simon",
     "occupation": "journalist",
     "friends": [ "pierre", "donald", "theresa"]
   }
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   json.name => "Basile Simon"
   json.friends[0]` => "pierre"
   #+END_SRC

   https://codepen.io/basilesimon/pen/MrZWZg?editors=1010#


** JSON and CSV in this course

   we're likely to store data when scraping, cleaning, etc. in CSV format.
   we'll probably use, or "parse" CSV data into JSON for the web.

   d3.js has a CSV parser: from the CSV above

   #+BEGIN_SRC
   name, occupation, height
   basile, journalist, 187
   donald, politician, 188
   #+END_SRC

   we parse it as JSON, so we can run `data.name` and get "basile" back

** file formats: Excel, databases

   Excel/ Google Spreadsheets are **visual representations** or CSV data

   Databases come with, as the DOM does, their programming interface and language (eg SQL)

** a word about Python
** Python
   
    Python is a programming language created in 1991.

    It is the most taught programming language around the world.

*** Why Python?

    Newsroom use: https://www.poynter.org/news/introduction-newsroom-programming-technologies

    Python is very easy to read and to use - and many newsrooms use it.

    **If you can write Python, you can write anything.**
   
** What Python looks like

    **Javascript**
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
    var foo = 'bar';
    function myFunction(parameter) {
      console.log(parameter);
    };
    #+END_SRC

    **Python**
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    foo = 'bar'
    def myFunction(parameter):
        print(parameter)
    #+END_SRC
